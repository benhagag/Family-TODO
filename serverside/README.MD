# Creating a RESTful API with Node.js

conect your MongoDB 
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/family');
var db = mongoose.connection;
db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'));
db.once('open', function() {
  console.log('we are connected to DB');
});

## Usage
Check out the branch you're interested in (i.e. which belongs to the video in my series you just watched), ```git clone``` it and thereafter run ```npm install```.

Make sure to also add your Mongo Atlas Admin Username to a nodemon.json file (which you have to create).

```
{
    "env": {
        "MONGO_ATLAS_PW": "YOUR_MONGO_USER_PW"
    }
}
```
